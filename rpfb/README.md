# Rust Programming for Beginners

This folder contains some of my rustlings from the hands on examples and exercises from the book of the same name, by Nathan Metzler.
ISBN 9798525883406

## Note

These are my rustlings, meled with book examples, and some may deviate slightly, so some of the code you see here is not exactly as it is in the book. As far as I can tell the book doesnt have its own dedicated git repo that I could fork, so Im just fiddling with rust as I follow along in the book and uploading the sources here so that I can clone it onto different machines that I may be working at to continue my studies, picking up where I left off (git fetch / git pull etc).
